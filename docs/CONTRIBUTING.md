## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report
- Check the debugging guide. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of the project.
- Check the discussions for a list of common questions and problems.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
- Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. 
- Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. 
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots which show you following the described steps to demonstrate the problem.
- Include details about your configuration and environment by answering the following questions:
    - What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
    - Are you running the system in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using?
    - Which NuGet packages do you have installed?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new system components and workflow nodes. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
- Check the debugging guide for tips â€” you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using the latest version of Atom and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.
Check if there's already a system componenet which provides that enhancement.
Determine which project the enhancement should be suggested in.
Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as discussions. After you've determined which project your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an discussion entry on that project and provide the following information:

- A clear and descriptive title for the discussion entry to identify the suggestion.
- A  step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots to demonstrate the steps or point out the part of the system which the suggestion is related to.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to the system users.
- Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.

### Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

*REMARK: Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.*

### Pull Requests
The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain system's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Data Workflows
- Enable a sustainable system for system's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- Follow all instructions in the template
- Follow the styleguides
- After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing
- What if the status checks are failing?
- While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

#### Pull Request Procedure
When you're done making the changes, open a pull request, often referred to as a PR, and:

- Fill out the "Ready for review" template so we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
