# Welcome to the Project

If you are a __junior developer__, first of all I want to give you special thanks for your interest in this project.

I hope this document helps you to clarify the benefits you are about to get from this project.

This project is __not difficult__ at all as it has many entry levels. Creating a windows service (a workflow node in the terminology of this project) is not rocket science. You can achieve it with a medium level in C #, depending of course, on what you want that service to carry out.

In short, keep in mind that:

- This project will help you to __sharp your skills__; A nice and efficient way to __everyday training.
- Unattended processes (fire-and-forget) and workflows are a __very important part of web development__ and microservices architecture; This project will allow you to be prepared to cover that area of development.
- This project will also __provide you with a codebase__ that you can use in all your projects.
- This project will allow you to get out of the so-called __"Tutorial Hell"__ if you have fallen into one.
- If you are looking for your first job, one of the best ways to help to achieve that is to gain experience at any cost, and one of the best ways to adquire that experience is by __contributing to GitHub projects__. GitHub gives you opportunity to __certify your skills__ yourself. If you do something that works, and works nicely, that is fact, and it can't be denied. That's it. 
- You're going to develop a __friends and contacts network__ which is very valuable asset (maybe one of them is your next employer!).
- Your are going to __learn from very experienced developers__, and you are going to learn how to collaborate in a project with other guys like yourself, and that one is a very important skill.
- You are going to learn __how to use GitHub__.
- You are going to learn how to __produce technical documentation__.

Take your time to choose your contribution path; There's a lot of them. Perhaps you can start by creating technical docs and its UML diagrams. As a junior developer, your contribution path is also your training path.

And perhaps, soon you're going to discover that you are no longer a junior developer.

This project can excite your creativity in an incredible way, since its use scenarios as well as the problems it can solve are practically unlimited; It can grown progressively fot futfil all your needs, but the best of all is that you are going to have fun.

## The Most Important Skill In Software Development

Learn to read code as you read the morning newspapers. You can to develop the ability to understand what a piece of code is doing just watching to it for a little while. This skill is going to make your life a lot more assier, because prepares you to deal better with the sytems complexity, cos you can understand easily every single part of these systems. 

It is hard. Is going to take some time. But the initial effort is worth it.

So you have to put yourself out of the comfort area, and start reading code; code made by other people with different ways of thinking than yours. People who express and write their ideas in a lot of different ways. And GitHub is a great way to find code to read and study. 

I have seen few companies that are capable of evaluating this ability when it comes to job interviews. They limit themselves to asking technical questions and submitting technical challenges to do at home. These approaches are good to evaluate the candiate reasoning and problem solving skills, but don't give the full picture of a given candiadate, i.e. these approaches doesn't provide metrics about how the candidate deals with the "code mess", which certainly must be there after years of system development by a lot of different people.

Since one of the the main missions of any software engineer is to try to reduce the systems entrophy, this is a very important skill that you want to adquire. 

That is why many people give up after being hired. They left the company or they get fired; Over complicated systems and low code-reading skills are an explosive mix.



Good luck and lets code!
