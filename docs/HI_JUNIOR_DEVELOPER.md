# Welcome to the Project

This project is not difficult at all; it has many entry levels. Creating a windows service (a workflow node in the terminology of this project) is not rocket science. You can achieve it with a medium level in C #, depending of course, on what you want that service to carry out.

In short, keep in mind that:

- This project will help you keep your skills sharp; A nice and efficient way to everyday training.
- Unattended processes (fire-and-forget) and workflows are a very important part of web development and microservices architecture; This project will allow you to be prepared to cover that area of development.
- This project will also provide you with a codebase that you can use in all your projects.
- This project will allow you to get out of the so-called "Tutorial Hell" if you have fallen into one.
- If you are looking for your first job, one of the best ways to help that is to gain experience at any cost, and one of the best ways to achieve that experience is by contributing to GitHub projects.
- You're going to develop a friends and contacts network which is very valuable asset (maybe one of them is your next employer!).
- Your are going to learn from very experienced developers, and you are going to learn how to collaborate in a project with other guys like yourself, and that one is a very important skill.
- You are going to learn how to use GitHub
- You are going to learn how to produce technical documentation.

I hope this document helps you to clarify the benefits you are about to get from this projects.

Good luck and lets code!
