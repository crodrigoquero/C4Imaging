# Welcome to the Project

If you are a __junior developer__, first of all I want to give you special thanks for your interest in this project.

This project is __not difficult__ at all as it has many entry levels. Creating a windows service (a workflow node in the terminology of this project) is not rocket science. You can achieve it with a medium level in C #, depending of course, on what you want that service to carry out.

In short, keep in mind that:

- This project will help you to __sharp your skills__; A nice and efficient way to __everyday training.
- Unattended processes (fire-and-forget) and workflows are a __very important part of web development__ and microservices architecture; This project will allow you to be prepared to cover that area of development.
- This project will also __provide you with a codebase__ that you can use in all your projects.
- This project will allow you to get out of the so-called __"Tutorial Hell"__ if you have fallen into one.
- If you are looking for your first job, one of the best ways to help to achieve that is to gain experience at any cost, and one of the best ways to adquire that experience is by __contributing to GitHub projects__. GitHub gives you opportunity to __certify your skills__ yourself. If you do something that works, and works nicely, that is fact, and it can't be denied. That's it. 
- You're going to develop a __friends and contacts network__ which is very valuable asset (maybe one of them is your next employer!).
- Your are going to __learn from very experienced developers__, and you are going to learn how to collaborate in a project with other guys like yourself, and that one is a very important skill.
- You are going to learn __how to use GitHub__.
- You are going to learn how to __produce technical documentation__.

Take your time to choose your contribution path; There's a lot of them. Perhaps you can start by creating technical docs and its UML diagrams. As a junior developer, your contribution path is also your training path.

And perhaps, soon you're going to discover that you are no longer a junior developer.

I hope this document helps you to clarify the benefits you are about to get from this projects.

Good luck and lets code!
