# Welcome to the Project

If you are a __software engineer with a lot of experience__, first of all I want to give you special thanks for your interest in this project.

In your case, you don't even have to program at all; Maybe you have already developed a similar project for a company throughout your career, so you can guide many with your advice; perhaps you may want to include some code examples in the proper discussions.

Your expertiese will be spacially valuable in the following topics:

1. If you have knowledge of AI, __neural networks and machine learning__, things can get really interesting; You can help us all by creating __TensorFlow models__ to classify images and all kinds of documents, which would trigger the project's functionality to infinity and beyond.
2. If your specialty is __frontend__, things can get interesting anyway, because you can help improve the __user experience__ in both web and desktop applications. UX is very complex topic and requieres years of experience and special habilities that not everybody of us can get. 
3. You can also help us to enforce __coding good practices__ and proper [Development Patters](../discussions/52) implementation.
4. You can help us to __migrate from older C# versions__ to new releases of the language.
5. You can help us to find and remove __"silent bugs"__.
6. You can show us __new application scenarios__ where deploy and use the system.
7. You can help us to improve this __project management and organisation__.
8. And plaase, help us to remove __memory leaks__ and code __bad smells__!
9. You can help us to enrich the [Developer_Resources](/../../not_found.md) document.

Additionally, someone like you must be able to find many other ways to contribute!
