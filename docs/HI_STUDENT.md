# Welcome to the Project

If you are a __software engineering student__, first of all I want to give you special thanks for your interest in this project.

Perhaps you're not too happy about what you got form the college in exchange of your time and your money. You are not alone, I'm afraid. The current educational system has a lot of lacks when it comes to IT.

You have the option of the "apprenticeships", but in many cases these are nothing more than modern forms of slavery, in which you will learn little and work a lot in exchange for peanuts. And this is due in part to the rapid evolution of technology and in part to the low capacity of adaptation of certain educational institutions, not all of them of course (especially the most expensive).

This lack of adaptation the on going changes comes from a series of diverse nature reasons, which I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT here because I no want to get more trouble that I already have.  

Also, in most cases college teachers have a little real experience in the IT market; Again, this not true in all cases, but it happens frequently. 

To finish worsening the situation, companies seek immediate benefit, in many cases they will not do anything to improve your training, so you will not get a job in their organization if you do not meet each and every one of the requirements they are looking for in a given sitation. This makes sense since frequently most employees are ungrateful and unloyal, in way that when they take the skills they need, they proceed to migrate to other companies to get a better payroll.

All of this is complicated tangle, and is difficult to get out from it. Perhaps the government needs to take some sort of action, and to get into the IT sector to regulate it, (I don't know), in way that the path form college to the first employment will get very clear and secure.

For one reason or another the true is, the situation of a student when he finished his studies is a little bit tricky.

Or maybe your situation looks a lot better that all of those. If that is the case, congratulations! Your win the lottery prize.

Maybe you have sent some applications for jobs, and things have not gone as you expected, so you feel you need even more training in a number of areas. 

The best way to complete your training, if you feel that you still have a series of lacks in your programming skills, is the "learn by doing" BTEC motto. And to do that, lets start contributing on GitHub. At some point in the middle term, you're going to have your own projects, but right now you can start cooperating in this one or uny other of your choice. 

Finally, the same advice I've provide through the document [Hi Junior Developer](./HI_JUNIOR_DEVELOPER.md) is applicable for you.


All the best in your career.
