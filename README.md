## About Workflows and Business Process Automation

A WorkFlow is like a kind of program or sequence of steps or phases, which is repeated regularly in a business environment, and in which people and / or software agents participate. There are several types of workflow, which I will talk about later.

Another possible definition of WorkFlow (more formal) is that it is a coordinated sequence of tasks in which different processing entities participate. These processing entities can be at different layers or levels within the system architecture, so they can be background workers, APIs, etc.

Each WorkFlow task runs in response to a WorkFlow managed business event. These events can be generated (triggered) by humans or by other processing entities. These events circulate or rather, flow, in the form of messages managed by a messaging engine (message broker). 

### APIS And Microservices Are Not Enough

Rest APIs provide only endpoints for users; they are not intended to carry out long processes.

The http requests that we send and receive from an API must be short (in time), a maximum of seconds, otherwise we will find ourselves faced with a huge nonsense: what is the point of launching an http request and having to wait minutes, even hours,  for that request to end?.

So we shouldn't try to get an API to do all the work. In these cases you have to resort to the __Background Workers__. In other words: the API will pass all the heavy lifting to a __background worker__; when it receives the job, it returns a __menssage__ of the type __"WORK_UNIT_STARTED"__ (or something similar) to the API. When the job is finished, the workflow will issue another message or notification to inform the API of this circumstance, with a message of the type __"WORK_UNIT_PROCESS_COMPLETED"__ or __"WORK_UNIT_PROCESS_FAILED"__, if an error has occurred during the process.

By the way, to implement this message flow we will need a __message broker__ like __RabbitMq__. Thus, both the API and the Backgrund Worker must be subscribed to such message broker.

In my opinion, if you are interested in Microservices architecture, you must first master the programming of operating system services or workers. Microservices and workers must work together and must communicate with each other through a __message broker__, as I have said before.

Many think only of APIs when they refer to microservices, but the truth is that a microservice can be several things: an API, an operating system service or (Daemon in Linux), a console application, etc.

### Cada workflow tiene su propia API

In the scenario that I am trying to describe, each workflow is made up of a series of Background Workers. The workflow has an API that allows applications to interact with it. Such API does more than being the workflow entry point, it also manages other things. Perhaps the API can implement an endpoint called "ProcessStatus" that accepts the __token__ of a process as a parameter. I will describe the API WorkFlow structure later. 

### Tipical Workflow Processes

- __Ducumental Approval / Human Aproval Process:__ Common business processes that require someone to sign off on the data at certain stage. An approval workflow is a logical sequence of tasks, including human approval and rejections, to process data.
- __Data Processing:__ Data processing is a series of operations that are carroed out on data, files and documents. These operations are traceable and can be organized sequentially or in parallel. 
- __Long Running Processes:__ A persistent workflow that can can last for hours, days or months. For example, the workflow send an order to an external system and waits for a response. The durantion is less important than the fact that you potentially have to wait, which is the case in almost any situation where remote users or remote communications are involved. 

### Exsisting Solutions

To articulate the business process in a workflow environment, there are some interesting proposals out there:

- __Camunda:__  C# library. It works well with .Net Core 3.x
- __Elsa:__ C# library
- __WorkFlow Engine:__ C# Library. It works well with .Net Core 3.x
- __Hangfire:__ Is all about executing jobs on servers (shceduled jobs). Has a web-based dashbord. It can run on a server.
- __Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management:__ Difficult to learn; high learning curve, and you have to pay a subscription fee every month for it.
